# @package _group_

num_classes: ???
  # The number of classes in the dataset. The dataset implementation should return a mask as a NumPy array with
  # the shape [height, width, num_classes]. In a case of binary segmentation you can set `num_classes` to 1.

architecture: Unet
  # The architecture of Semantic Segmentation Model. AutoAlbument uses models from
  # https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch. Please refer to its documentation to get a list of available
  # models - https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch#models-.

encoder_architecture: se_resnext50_32x4d
  # The architecture of encoder in Semantic Segmentation Model. Please refer to Segmentation Models' documentation to
  # get a list of available encoders - https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch#encoders-

pretrained: True
  # Either boolean flag or string with that indicates whether the selected encoder architecture should load pretrained
  # weights or use randomly initialized weights.
  # - In the case of boolean flag `true` means using pretrained weights from ImageNet and `false` means using randomly
  #   initialized weights.
  # - In the case of string the value should specify the name of the weights. For the list of available weights please
  #   refer to https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch#encoders-
